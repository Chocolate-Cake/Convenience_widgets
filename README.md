pages.py

Given some powerpoint or similar where you want to print multiple slides on each page and (may) also want to skip certain slides, input the relevant info and get the page numbers to enter into the "print these specific pages" box in the printing interface. Get number sets for front and back of each page. Is my way of trying to save paper and ink when printing a bunch of powerpoints for class.

accounting.py

Randomly generate accounting Q&As to prepare for IB interviews.

op_tree.py

data_cleaner.py

Given a source folder, convert all csv files into cropped csv files of default 100 rows, convert all dta files into csv files of default 100 rows. Is my way of handling Stata with no Stata software.
